# 🍔 GoFood – Fast Food Delivery Website UI (Figma Practice)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **UI design mockup for a fast food delivery landing page**, created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) during my free time as part of personal learning and UI/UX design exploration.

The design concept is focused on a visually appealing, high-impact **hero section** with a giant burger image, bold call-to-actions, and clean navigation – ideal for a modern food delivery brand like "GoFood".

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of this project was to:
- Practice layout and component design using **Figma Free**
- Create a visually rich and functional landing page for a fictional food brand
- Explore typography, hierarchy, and image-based interface design
- Enhance real-world UI prototyping and visual storytelling skills
