# 🍔 GoFood – Fast Food Delivery Website UI (Figma Practice)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **UI design mockup for a fast food delivery landing page**, created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) during my free time as part of personal learning and UI/UX design exploration.

The design concept is focused on a visually appealing, high-impact **hero section** with a giant burger image, bold call-to-actions, and clean navigation – ideal for a modern food delivery brand like "GoFood".
